Idea 1: (this may be too complex to model and if I discover that is the case then I could switch it to live scraping data for over-under to discrepancies)

NBA player fantasy expectation:

I am trying to accurately model players expected point earned, and find the optimal lineup to play. 
This is made difficult because players have different ‘salaries’ and a person has a cap limit.

I would model nba players fantasy point projections:
this is calculated by the points scored, rebounds, steals, assists, blocks, turnovers, and 3 pointers made.
I might want to do two models, one that can be used halfway through the season and be trained on the first half’s data,
and one that uses all data collected. The first model is because I expect better results for a model trained on the current season.
The second is because I still want to be able to model the expectations at the beginning of the season.

Question to answer:
Accurately predict fantasy scores

Presentation:
Powerpoint most likely

Data Sources:
I would get my data mostly from ESPN, but also NBA.com, basketball reference, and also the data on previous fantasy points earned from sportsline, draftkings, etc.

Next Step:
Next step is collecting data.



Idea 2:

Modeling crypto to predict future prices (and also possibly show relationship between public views)

I would like to model crypto prices using historical data and twitter hashtags. The currencies that I would like to model are litecoin, 
dogecoin, ethereum, but those aren’t the final decisions. I would like to show the correlation between peoples views 
on these cryptocurrencies and the price.


Question to answer:
Predict crypto prices and show correlation between peoples view and the prices

Presentation:
Powerpoint most likely

Data Sources:
My Data would come from twitter for people and coinapi, cryptocompare etc for the historical data

Next Step:
Next step is collecting data.



Idea 3:

I want to make a recommender, for what is something I am still deciding. Ideas are things like ebay, etsy, walmart, 
or some other trading platform.

I do not know how to make a recommender so the description is


Question to answer:
Create a recommender that could increase the views and therefore increase the amount of purchases
Presentation:
Powerpoint most likely

Data Sources:
My Data would come from ebay, etsy, or whatever I am making the predictor for

Next Step:
Next step is collecting data.
